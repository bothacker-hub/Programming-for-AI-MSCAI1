### Setup and Initialization:

# Libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, and pymongo are imported.
# Warnings are suppressed to streamline output readability.

### Dataset Acquisition:

# The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle using the kagglehub library.
# Specific paths and dataset information are handled dynamically.

### MongoDB Integration:

# The MongoDB database is initialized locally with collections representing different product categories.
# Data from CSV files are loaded into MongoDB collections.

### Data Preprocessing:

# Each MongoDB collection is read into a pandas DataFrame.
# Duplicates and irrelevant columns (e.g., those with all zero values) are removed.
# Cleaned data is saved back to new collections.

### Feature Engineering:

# Transformations such as discount percentage calculation, price binning, and feature concatenation are applied.
# The transformed data is stored in separate MongoDB collections.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

# Summary statistics, missing value counts, and correlation matrices are generated for numerical data.
# Heatmap is used to visualize correlations.

### Visualization:

# Both static (matplotlib and seaborn) and interactive (plotly.express) plots are generated for various features:
# Scatter plot (price vs. discount_percent).
# Histogram (discount_percent distribution).
# Countplots for categorical data distribution.
